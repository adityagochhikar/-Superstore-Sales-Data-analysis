# ðŸ“Š Canada Retail Store Sales Analysis

# ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

A leading retail store in Canada wants to analyze sales & profitability across various regions. The goal is to:

âœ” Identify the most profitable product subcategories to maximize revenue.

âœ” Detect loss-making subcategories to decide whether to discontinue or optimize them.

# ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview

ðŸ“Œ Regions & Provinces â€“ Sales data is divided into major Canadian regions & provinces.

ðŸ“Œ Product Base Margin â€“ Profit margin per product.

ðŸ“Œ Customer Segments â€“ Includes Corporate, Home Office, Small Business, and Consumer.

# ðŸ”„ Activity 1: Data Cleaning & Report Formatting

 ðŸ“Œ Section 1: Basic Formatting

âœ… Adjust column widths for readability.

âœ… Style the header row with colors & apply borders.


ðŸ“Œ Section 2: Filtering & Segmenting

âœ… Filter data by customer segment (Corporate, Home Office, Small Business, Consumer).

âœ… Create 4 separate sheets, one for each segment.

âœ… Work only with the Corporate segment for analysis.

ðŸ“Œ Section 3: Report Preparation - I

âœ… Freeze the header row for easy navigation.

âœ… Hide/delete unnecessary columns for better clarity.

âœ… Round off sales & profits to one decimal place.

âœ… Format sales & profits in USD.

âœ… Change Order Date & Ship Date to a more readable format (e.g., 15-Jan-2012).

ðŸ“Œ Section 4: Report Preparation - II

âœ” Sorting:

Alphabetically by Region

Within each Region, sort by Province

Within Province, sort by sales in decreasing order

âœ” Conditional Formatting - I:

Highlight the top 10% orders by sales (light green fill, dark green border).

âœ” Conditional Formatting - II:

Profit: Green for high profits, Red for losses (Darker shade for extreme values).

ðŸ“Œ Section 5: Report Preparation - III

âœ… Apply double bottom borders to separate each region visually.

# ðŸ”„ Activity 2: Profitability & Loss Analysis

ðŸ“Œ 1. High-Profit Categories

âœ… Use Pivot Tables to find the Top 3 most profitable product subcategories in each region.

âœ… Compare profits across regions and identify trends & exceptions.

âœ… Apply Conditional Formatting to highlight extreme profit values.

ðŸ“Œ 2. Loss-Making Categories

âœ… Identify least profitable (highest loss) subcategories.

âœ… Determine which regions contribute the most to losses.

âœ… Analyze product bundling patterns (e.g., Tables & Chairs) to understand business impact.

# ðŸš€ Key Business Insights

âœ” Most profitable product subcategories can be further promoted for revenue growth.

âœ” Loss-making categories need a strategic review (discontinue or optimize sales approach).

âœ” Bundling opportunities (e.g., Tables & Chairs) should be explored to increase profitability.

ðŸ”¹ Future Scope:
ðŸš€ Implement advanced data visualization in Power BI for deeper insights.
